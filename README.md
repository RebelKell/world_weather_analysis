# World Weather Analysis

## Overview
This project was intended to provide our client with the framework for an app that allows customers to input desired temperature ranges for a vacation, within a defined range of longitudes and latitudes, and output ideal hotel locations with their weather. 

## Tools Utilized
We used APIs from Open Weather Map and Google (maps, places, directions) to create this app framework. Our code consists of various pandas dataframes, API calls, conditional logic, and figure creation.
